# DNA-counter
My first small project to count the letters in a genetic sequence, and calculate the GC and AT content.

## Usage
You can input a Genetic Sequence for instance, "ATGCTAGGCTTACG", and the program will interpret the sequence to count the letters (A, T, G, C) and also calculate the GC and AT content.

## To-do
- [X] Input and counting
- [X] Calculation of GC and AT content
- [X] UI
- [X] Program i.e, .exe

## Installation
You can clone the git by running this:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ArnavDevelops/DNA-counter
```
and then going to
```shell
DNA-counter\dist\dna_counter.exe
```
and running the .exe file

## Contribution
You're free to contribute especially with GUI-related things.
