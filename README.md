# DNA-counter
My first small project to count the letters in a genetic sequence, and calculate the GC and AT content.

## Usage
You can input a Genetic Sequence for instance, "ATGCTAGGCTTACG", and the program will interpret the sequence to count the letters (A, T, G, C) and also calculate the GC and AT content.

## To-do
[X] Input and counting
[X] Calculation of GC and AT content
[] UI
[] Program i.e, .exe
